* _mergeTwins.jsx_ - script for merging pairs of layers. Top one contains outline of character and bottom
                     is coloring. Use # in layer or group name to skip merging. Script tries to keep 
                     relations between layers and groups.
* _removeOnlyGroups.jsx_ - remove all groups and preserve layers in original order.
* _layersToSprite.jsx_ - converts layers to big sprite with width limitation specified in **maximumSpriteWidth** variable.
                         Script starts from bottom layer, groups ignored.
